## Proof That Corporate Bullshit Is Timeless

Robert C. Townsend wrote Up the Organization in 1969. If you didn’t know the date, you could easily mistake it for a critique of today’s corporate world.

Decades before management jargon took over, Townsend was already advocating for what modern companies now brand as innovation: agile and lean management, flat organizations, empowered teams, servant leadership, and an open war on bureaucracy. His insight was brutally simple: organizations don’t fail because people are stupid—they fail because systems are.

The book reads like an indictment of corporate habits that refuse to die. Layers of management, meaningless processes, endless meetings, KPI theatre, and decisions diluted by “alignment.” Fifty years later, corporate bullshit hasn’t disappeared. It has professionalized.

This is why the book hits particularly hard if you’ve recently joined a large corporation after working in a startup or a smaller company. Suddenly, speed is replaced by process, responsibility by approval chains, and common sense by policy. Townsend doesn’t just describe that frustration—he legitimizes it.

Up the Organization is not a nostalgic management classic. It’s a reminder that bureaucracy is not a bug in organizations. It’s their default mode. And unless leaders consciously fight it, it will always win.
