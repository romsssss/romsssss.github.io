## Organize for Flow, Not Hierarchy

Most organizations are structured for control, not delivery—and it shows in slow releases, frustrated engineers, and endless handoffs. Team Topologies flips the script: the structure of your teams should maximize software delivery flow while keeping cognitive load manageable.

The book introduces four team types designed for high-performance delivery:

1. **Stream-aligned teams** — Own a single product, service, or value stream end-to-end. They minimize handoffs and are empowered to deliver independently.

2. **Enabling teams** — Coach, mentor, and remove obstacles for other teams, helping them adopt new skills or technologies.

3. **Complicated-subsystem teams** — Own areas that require deep specialist knowledge or are inherently complex.

4. **Platform teams** — Provide self-service tools, APIs, or infrastructure so stream-aligned teams can focus on delivery without reinventing the wheel.

Equally important is how teams interact. Skelton & Pais identify three primary interaction modes:

* **Collaboration**: Two teams work closely to solve a problem together.

* **X-as-a-Service**: One team provides a service to another via well-defined interfaces, reducing dependencies.

* **Facilitating**: One team helps another overcome obstacles or adopt new capabilities, usually temporarily.

The key insight: teams are a system, not islands. By defining clear boundaries, responsibilities, and interactions, organizations can reduce bottlenecks, empower teams, and ship software faster.

Who it’s useful for:

* Engineering managers and tech leads designing or scaling teams

* CTOs and heads of product shaping organizational structure

* Anyone frustrated with slow delivery, overworked engineers, or bloated processes
