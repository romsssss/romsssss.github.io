The *Power of Bad* dives into the psychological force known as the **negativity bias** — our tendency to let negative experiences and criticism outweigh positive ones in how we think and act. Tierney and Baumeister show how this bias shapes relationships, careers, teams, and society, explaining why a single bad comment can overshadow countless successes and why we often fixate on problems rather than solutions.

What makes this book valuable — especially for anyone managing a persistently negative colleague — is its **practical lens on how negativity actually works** and how to counterbalance it. Rather than dismissing negative people as “just difficult,” the book gives you tools to understand where their focus comes from, avoid letting their pessimism dominate team dynamics, and encourage a healthier dialogue that focuses on strengths and resilience.

**Who should read it**: managers, team leaders, and anyone dealing with chronic negativity in work or relationships — especially if you want to understand why negativity has such outsized impact and how to respond in ways that build morale instead of feeding the fire.
