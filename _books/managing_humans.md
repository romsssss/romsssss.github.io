## A Dip-in Guide for Engineering Managers

Managing Humans by Michael Lopp isn’t a textbook you read cover-to-cover—it’s a collection of essays, anecdotes, and hard-won insights that you can pick up, read a chapter, and immediately apply. It’s like a curated mashup of blog posts on engineering leadership, team dynamics, and culture, each standing on its own but adding up to a coherent worldview.

Of the 52 chapters, these are the ones that resonated most with me:

* **The Rand Test** — Ten quick questions to gauge the true health of your team.

* **Subtlety, Subterfuges, and Silence** — Learn to listen to what’s not said; hidden signals often matter more than words.

* **Hacking is Important** — Encourage engineers to experiment, tinker, and innovate to stay motivated.

* **Bored People Quit** — Challenging work keeps top talent engaged; stagnation drives them away.

The book shines for engineering managers, tech leads, and anyone navigating the tricky realities of team dynamics in software organizations. You won’t get a linear framework, but you’ll get practical, funny, and often brutally honest advice that resonates with real-world experience.
