Design Patterns in Ruby is a quiet rebellion against pattern dogma. It shows that design patterns are not sacred templates, but pragmatic ideas that should adapt to the language—not the other way around. By leveraging Ruby’s expressiveness, many heavyweight patterns shrink into simple, elegant constructs, exposing an uncomfortable truth: complexity often comes not from the problem, but from the way we choose to solve it.

This book is particularly valuable for developers who learned design patterns through Java or C++ and are discovering Ruby—or, more broadly, for anyone who suspects that “enterprise architecture” sometimes means solving simple problems in complicated ways.
