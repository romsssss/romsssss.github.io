  <p>Hi 👋, I'm Romain Vigo Benia — a software engineering leader who's spent the past decade building and scaling engineering teams, from fast-moving startups to large, global organizations.</p>

  <p>I've learned (often the hard way) what actually works in software development versus what just sounds good in theory. I'm deeply skeptical of cargo-cult practices like story point estimation, excessive meetings, and process for process's sake.</p>

  <p>My approach: <strong>design deliberately, ship iteratively, invest in quality, and cut through the noise.</strong> I believe the best engineering teams are built on trust, pragmatism, and a relentless focus on delivering value.</p>

  <p>I write about engineering leadership, remote collaboration, code quality, and the timeless principles that matter when building software that lasts.</p>

  <p>You'll find <a href="/blog">my writing here</a> and <a href="/books">reading notes here</a>.</p>
