title: "Why turning your camera on matters in remote software teams"

Remote work is no longer an experiment in software development — it’s the default.
Yet one debate keeps resurfacing in remote teams:

*Should we turn our cameras on during meetings?*

Some see cameras as unnecessary, intrusive, or exhausting. Others view them as essential for collaboration.
The truth, like most things in engineering, is nuanced — but *used intentionally, cameras are a powerful tool for better software teams*.

This post explains *why* camera usage matters, *when* it adds real value, and *how* to apply it without burning people out.

## Software development is a social activity (even if the output is code)

We like to think of software development as a purely logical activity. It’s not.

Design discussions, code reviews, incident debriefs, and planning sessions are **human conversations**, not just information exchanges. These conversations rely heavily on non-verbal signals: confusion, agreement, hesitation, discomfort, engagement

With cameras off, all of that disappears.

You may still hear the words, but you lose context, emotional feedback, and shared understanding.
The result is familiar:

- Longer meetings
- More follow-ups
- Decisions that *seem* aligned but aren’t

Video doesn’t replace good communication — but it **restores part of what remote work removes by default**.

## Communication has bandwidth (and we often ignore it)

Decades of research in organizational psychology describe this idea under **Media Richness Theory**.

The core idea is simple:

> Communication channels differ in how much information they can carry.
> The more complex, ambiguous, or emotionally loaded a topic is, the richer the communication medium needs to be.

A “rich” medium allows:

- Immediate feedback
- Multiple cues (facial expressions, tone, posture)
- Natural back-and-forth
- Personal focus

This maps *perfectly* to modern software teams.

Not all communication channels are equal. Here’s a practical hierarchy, from richest to poorest:

The higher you go:

- The more nuance you transmit
- The faster misunderstandings are resolved
- The easier it is to build trust

The lower you go:

- The more ambiguity increases
- The more context is lost
- The higher the risk of misalignment

## Why cameras matter in this pyramid

Turning cameras on isn’t about etiquette or surveillance.
It’s about **bandwidth**.

Enabling video increases signal density, restores non-verbal cues, shortens feedback loops, and improves shared understanding.

In pyramid terms:

> **Camera ON moves a conversation up one full level of richness.**

That’s a meaningful upgrade for discussions where coordination matters: planning, retrospectives, design reviews, onboarding, and (in many teams) stand-ups.

## From bandwidth to engagement to trust

Bandwidth affects understanding first — engagement second — and trust over time.

With cameras off, meetings often drift toward:

- Multitasking
- Half-listening
- Reading updates aloud

Turning cameras on subtly changes behavior:

- People are more present
- Speakers get visual feedback
- Silence becomes intentional, not accidental

This isn’t about control. It’s about shared attention.

Over time, that shared attention compounds into trust and psychological safety — things co-located teams get for free, and remote teams must build deliberately.

## The Slack problem

Here’s an uncomfortable truth:

> Most communication problems in software teams aren’t people problems —
> they’re **bandwidth mismatches**.

We routinely try to debate architecture in Slack threads, resolve disagreement via text, express nuance with emojis, or “Align” asynchronously.

Slack is **lossy compression for human communication**.

You wouldn’t debug a race condition via screenshots.
You wouldn’t review a complex PR through commit messages alone.

Yet we constantly try to make trade-offs and reach alignment using the **lowest-bandwidth channel available**.

Then we’re surprised when decisions get reopened, people feel unheard, trust erodes, or meetings multiply.

## A simple rule of thumb

You can summarize everything above with one rule:

> **The higher the ambiguity, the richer the channel.**

Or more bluntly:

> If a topic needs more than three Slack messages, it probably deserves a call.
> If it deserves a call, it probably deserves cameras.

This single heuristic prevents a *huge* amount of dysfunction.

## Cameras should be intentional, not mandatory

This is not an argument for “cameras always on”.

Forcing cameras:

- Increases fatigue
- Penalizes neurodivergent teammates
- Ignores privacy constraints
- Reduces trust instead of building it

A healthy approach looks like this:

### When cameras add real value

- Stand-ups
- Planning & retrospectives
- Design discussions
- Onboarding
- 1:1s (by mutual agreement)

### When cameras should be optional

- Large broadcast meetings
- Quick syncs
- Deep focus sessions
- Incidents after hours

The goal isn’t visibility — it’s **connection where connection matters**.

## How to introduce this without being weird about it

If your team is camera-off today, don’t flip a switch overnight.

Instead:

1. Explain the *why*
2. Start with specific meetings
3. Make it a team agreement, not a mandate
4. Allow exceptions without justification
5. Lead by example

A simple framing works well:

> “For meetings where collaboration and discussion matter, we’ll try cameras on to improve clarity and connection.”

No guilt. No judgment. No surveillance.

## Final thought

Remote software development works — but only if we intentionally replace what distance removes.

Cameras aren’t about productivity theater.
They’re about **bandwidth, trust, and shared understanding**.

Used thoughtfully, turning your camera on isn’t a burden —
it’s a small act that makes remote teams feel like actual teams again.
